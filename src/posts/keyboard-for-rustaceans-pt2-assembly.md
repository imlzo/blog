The PCB has arrived, fresh from the fab:

It's beautiful. Time to put it all together.

## Assembly

This build involved:

1. [Tape modding choc
   switches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YBNRXRXG0w&ab_channel=SamMohr) for
   sound, at the expense of my sanity.
2. Installing mill-max sockets for hotswap switch support.
3. Soldering the nice!nanos, battery, and power switch.

After a night of two of diligent hacking, I had a quiet, low-profile, wireless,
hotswap, split 32-key shrine for Ferris the Crab.

Next up is the firmware.
