I love technology, but I worry about the development of future interfaces -
technologies that are increasingly invisible and embedded in reality.

Why is that?

## Future Interfaces are Invisible

I think it's fair to say we're moving away from screen-based interfaces, to ones
that are more accessible and less taxing - like digital assistants, IoTs, and
wearables. These future interfaces try to fit naturally in the context of our
reality.

I feel like that's a great thing. I'd prefer not to carry a small, distracting
TV if I can avoid it. I want networked superpowers without being absorbed by the
means I access them through. I want the machines to "do what I mean" without
having to peck away at a piece of glass.

Nonetheless, I struggle to celebrate this trend wholeheartedly. Technology that
can dissolve out of awareness feels dangerous if it's built without transparency
and agency for people using it.

## Agency in Technology

Consumer tech - smartphones, wearables, [brain
chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink) - is like a network-connected
organ. Like my eyes and ears, it's the means I experience reality through:

```markdown
                ╔══════════╗   ┌─────────┐
             ┌─▶║   Tech   ║──▶│         │
             │  ╚══════════╝   │         │
┌──────────┐ │  ┌──────────┐   │         │

             │  ┌──────────┐   │         │
             └─▶│   Ears   │──▶│         │
                └──────────┘   └─────────┘
```

With future interfaces, technology is integrated even deeper as part of our
perception - deeper than personal computers and smartphones ever have been.

For something I rely on so intimately, I feel little agency in the technology I
use everyday. It is often changed, optimized, and updated over-the-air entirely
without my involvement or awareness.

There is a fundamental asymmetry here. The information and means to intervene is
disproportionately outside my hands.

## Transparency in Technology

Transparent technology is where people have understanding, control, and
awareness of how it works. It's the ability to peer behind the curtain, and
change things if needed.

Future interfaces may be easier to use, but whether or not they provide
transparency is questionable. It's increasingly invisible, but not transparent.

It's worth acknowledging the role of complexity. "Simple-to-use" technology is
incredibly complicated. I think this has always been true, even before machine
learning. The boundary between reality and computers is often messy (and a lot
of code) - think [libicu](https://icu.unicode.org/).

As tech's complexity grows and transparency decreases, having a comprehensive
understanding of everything I use feels daunting - if not impossible.

## The Cost of Innovation

Here's the rub: technology depends on capital. The infrastructure and workforce
required to maintain it is nonzero.

The cost is especially large for new, emerging technology. It's only natural
that people are financially driven to offset the initial investments.

I don't believe profit is inherently bad - but in face of financial pressure,
can tech companies, executives, and individuals be trusted? I feel that even
with a group of well-meaning people, narrow incentives can sometimes lead to
problematic decisions.

## Putting it Together

We're in a situation where technology is:

- deeply embedded in our experience of reality,
- built with less user agency, and
- developed with financial (or narrow) incentives

I worry about this. It seems too easy to act against people's best interests,
hide it behind complexity, and externalize blame.

## Ethics in Building Technology

When I began working on consumer technology, I was 19. My priority was financial
stability. It's only now that I realize the weight of responsibility in building
technology for the people. After all, I didn't need to take the Hippocratic oath
before I began working on iPhones.

It's easy to forget the influence of technology and what it normalizes through
its sheer reach. Small ethical "slips" snowball into unbelievable versions of
reality in the span of few years. We've gone from ankle monitors, to proctoring
software, to [Microsoft 365 becoming
spyware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/productivity/productivity-score).
I suppose we've become numbed to new norms, and the observant critics get worn
down. The [Shitty Technology Adoption
Curve](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1331633102762831873) is real. 

This is not the kind of technology I want to live with or bring into reality.

## What to do?

I don't believe my "worries" can be solved by a purely technical or legislative
approach. Perhaps I want a cultural shift in how technology is developed and the
values placed in them - but that may take more time. What can I do today?

Without being too sure, I want to focus my own time and money on technology that
is transparent and responsible:

*Transparent*, meaning technology that everyone can use, understand, and
intervene with.

*Responsible*, meaning technology that has people's best interests in mind.

I'm sure I won't be perfect, but I feel strongly about being accountable to
this goal. Let this be a record.
